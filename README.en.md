# [World Internet IP Address Database] V2.1

#### introduce
[World Internet IP Address Database] V2.1, this open source version is a new design combined with the new development of the super APIkey.Net project interface, which realizes the rapid deployment in an all-round way, code refactoring to achieve the minimum code amount and the maximum functional performance and other characteristics. Install and deploy out-of-the-box principles.Online demo address: https://www.ipoot.com


#### Software Architecture
[World Internet IP Address Database] V2.1, using B/S architecture, namely browser and server architecture mode (PHP+MySQL architecture mode), is a change or improvement of C/S architecture with the rise of Internet technology 's architecture. This mode unifies the client and concentrates the core part of the system function realization on the server, which simplifies the development, maintenance and use of the system. The user's browser exchanges data with the server database through the Web Server, which greatly simplifies the client computer load, reduces the cost and workload of the user's system maintenance and upgrade, and reduces the user's overall cost (TCO). [World Internet IP Address Database] V2.1, supports PHP3.0, PHP4.4, PHP5.3.X, PHP5.4.X, PHP5.5.X, PHP5.6.X, PHP7.0.X, PHP7.1.X, PHP7.2.X, PHP7.3.X, PHP7.4.X, PHP8.0.X.


#### Installation Tutorial

1. After downloading the software package (a total of 6 files: index.php, conn.php, ipoot_db.sql, images/ipoot.css, images/ipoot.js, images/ipoot.png), upload it to the server directory (also supports secondary directory and root directory, etc.);
2. Configure the database file: configure the created database information in the file conn.php (if the project does not use the history query function, this operation can be avoided.)
3. Upload the database update to the database: upload the iboot_db.sql database file to your own database (if the project does not use the history query function, this operation can be avoided.)

#### Instructions for use

1. After the project is deployed, various functions of the program can be used through the deployment path: 1. IP address query function; 2. Domain name resolution query function; 3. Digital IP address query function; 4. Website query function; 5. User Use the record history function.
2. The one-click deployment of the project is quickly launched, and the single-point deployment multiplexing feature is adopted, which can easily carry out secondary development according to its own needs, and even compress the project software package into a file for use;
3. The [World Internet IP Address Database] project listens to users' voices at any time, responds to users' expectations, welcomes users, and submits secondary development content to merge into this open source project for the benefit of fans.
